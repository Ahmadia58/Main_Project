# ✅ Data Quality Tests Summary

## 🧪 Tests Performed
The following data quality checks were conducted:
- **Uniqueness tests** on primary keys
- **Null value analysis** across all columns
- **Outlier detection** for numeric fields (e.g., `freight_value`, `payment_value`)
- **Date consistency checks** (e.g., delivery date should be after purchase date)
- **Referential integrity** between related tables
- **Duplicate row detection**
- **Data type validation** for each column

## 📊 Tables Tested
- `order_fact`
- `customer_dim`
- `product_dim`
- `seller_dim`


## ⚠️ Issues Found
- **Invalid delivery dates**:NO.
- **Outliers in `freight_value`**: Nothing
- **Duplicate rows**: No
- **Nulls in product**: Zero

## ✅ Final Status After Fixes
- All invalid dates were removed or corrected.
- Outliers were either capped or excluded based on business logic.
- Missing review messages were filled with placeholder text.
- Duplicate rows were dropped.
- Null values in product dimensions were imputed or removed.
- All tables now pass integrity and consistency checks.
